This webpage includes two screens – The home Page which describes about me and my interests in academics and my hobbies.
I have also enclosed my social media links for the General Public to connect with me.
The second page includes pictures of what I do in my Free time, this is available when I click the button – Fun Time Activities. 
The layout and design of both the screens have been maintained to be similar.
